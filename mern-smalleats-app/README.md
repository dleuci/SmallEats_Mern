Once node js is added to path open and close vs code and navigate back to the project folder.
Open mern-smalleats-app in the integrated terminal and type the command 
npm install
then
npm install-all
This will take a little but it will install all the required local files to run the website. 
Then install global nodemon
npm i -g nodemon
Once the install is finished type
npm run dev
This should automatically open a web browser to localhost:3000 and you should be able to see the website. 


npm run dev will start the server whenever you need to access it moving forward
